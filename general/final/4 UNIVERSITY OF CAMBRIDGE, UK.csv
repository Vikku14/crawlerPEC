",Visualization of Early Events in Acetic Acid Denaturation of HIV-1 Protease: A Molecular Dynamics Study,About the Authors,Dr Aditi Narendra Borkar,Centre for Misfolding Diseases,Aditi Borkar,People,Borkar,Aditi,PLOS ONE","We are hiring | Founder, Director RHy-X Limited | Anne McLaren Fellow, University of Nottingham",",Duplicate citations,Contact,Upload PDF,Competing Interests,Postdoctoral researcher,Author Contributions,College,Co-authors,Research Summary,Current Research,Follow this author,Recent Publications,Get social,Add co-authors,Protein denaturation plays a crucial role in cellular processes. In this study, denaturation of HIV-1 Protease (PR) was investigated by all-atom MD simulations in explicit solvent. The PR dimer and monomer were simulated separately in 9 M acetic acid (9 M AcOH) solution and water to study the denaturation process of PR in acetic acid environment. Direct visualization of the denaturation dynamics that is readily available from such simulations has been presented. Our simulations in 9 M AcOH reveal that the PR denaturation begins by separation of dimer into intact monomers and it is only after this separation that the monomer units start denaturing. The denaturation of the monomers is flagged off by the loss of crucial interactions between the α-helix at C-terminal and surrounding β-strands. This causes the structure to transit from the equilibrium dynamics to random non-equilibrating dynamics. Residence time calculations indicate that denaturation occurs via direct interaction of the acetic acid molecules with certain regions of the protein in 9 M AcOH. All these observations have helped to decipher a picture of the early events in acetic acid denaturation of PR and have illustrated that the α-helix and the β-sheet at the C-terminus of a native and functional PR dimer should maintain both the stability and the function of the enzyme and thus present newer targets for blocking PR function.,Related links,Biography,Merged citations,Publications,Telephone number,Expertise Summary,Legal information,School of Veterinary Medicine and Science,Future Research,‪University of Cambridge‬ - ‪‪Cited by 118‬‬ - ‪Structural biology‬ - ‪biochemistry‬,Past Research,Citations per year",Research,"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, UK","Nottinghamshire, England, United Kingdom",",Lensfield Road,Sutton Bonington Campus,Room A56 The Vet School,Directions,Leicestershire,UK,enquiries@ch.cam.ac.uk,T: +44 (0) 1223 336300,Contacts,Cambridge,University Privacy Policy,Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry,CB2 1EW,Contact,Sutton Bonington,work,LE12 5RD",No data,Doctor of Philosophy (PhD),Biophysical Chemistry,2014,University of Cambridge,Master of Science (M.Sc.),Biotechnology,2009,University of Pune,No data,No data,No data,No data,"Anne McLaren Fellow (Tenure Track) at University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom","https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure/image?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019830.g006&size=inline,https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations/images/avatar_scholar_256.png,https://journals.plos.org/resource/img/icon.email.16.png,https://journals.plos.org/resource/img/icon.linkedin.16.png,https://journals.plos.org/resource/img/logo-plos.png,https://journals.plos.org/resource/img/logo-plos-footer.png,https://orcid.org/static/release-1.298.3/img/orcid-og-image.png,https://www.nottingham.ac.uk/vet/people/staff-images/aditiborkar.jpg,https://crossmark-cdn.crossref.org/widget/v2.0/logos/CROSSMARK_BW_horizontal.svg","mailto:webmaster@plos.org,mailto:enquiries@ch.cam.ac.uk,* E-mail:,mailto:Aditi.Borkar@nottingham.ac.uk,mailto:hosur@tifr.res.in,mailto:?subject=Aditi Borkar - The University of Nottingham&body=I%20found%20this%20great%20page%20on%20the%20University%20of%20Nottingham%20website%20and%20I%20thought%20you%20might%20like%20it.%20http://live-uon.cloud.contensis.com/vet/people/aditi.borkar,mailto:veterinary-enquiries@nottingham.ac.uk,mailto:?subject=Visualization of Early Events in Acetic Acid Denaturation of HIV-1 Protease: A Molecular Dynamics Study&body=I%20thought%20you%20would%20find%20this%20article%20interesting.%20From%20PLOS ONE:%20https%3A%2F%2Fdx.plos.org%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0019830,Email address for updates",No data,"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aditi-borkar-69396210/?originalSubdomain=uk

",JavaScript is not available.,Nishad Sohoni,The influence of an upstream pylon on open rotor aerodynamics at angle of attack",Senior Software Engineer at CMR Surgical,"Contact Details,54,The aerodynamic impact of installing a horizontal pylon in front of a contra-rotating open rotor engine, at take-off, was studied. The unsteady interactions of the pylon's wake and potential field with the rotor blades were predicted by full-annulus URANS CFD calculations at 0° and 12° angle of attack (AoA). Two pylon configurations were studied: one where the front rotor blades move down behind the pylon (DBP), and one where they move up behind the pylon (UBP). When operating at 12° AoA, the UBP orientation was shown to reduce the rear rotor tip vortex sizes and separated flow regions, whereas the front rotor wake and vortex sizes were increased. In contrast, the DBP orientation was found to reduce the incidence variations onto the front rotor, leading to smaller wakes and vortices. The engine flow was also time-averaged, and the variation in work done on average mid-span streamlines was shown to depend strongly on variation in incidence, along with a smaller contribution related to change of radius.,Informations,Contact,Affiliations,70",Medical Device,"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, UK","Greater Cambridge Area, United Kingdom,1 JJ Thomson Avenue,Whittle Laboratory,",",Contact Details,Cambridge,Support,Contact,CB3 0DY,1 JJ Thomson Avenue,Whittle Laboratory,","Aerospace, Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering University of Cambridge",Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.),"Aerospace, Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering",2016,University of Cambridge,No data,No data,No data,No data,No data,No data,No data,No data,"Senior Software Engineer at CMR Surgical, Cambridge, England, United Kingdom","https://piwik-hal.ccsd.cnrs.fr//matomo.php?idsite=17&rec=1,https://piwik-hal.ccsd.cnrs.fr//matomo.php?idsite=92&rec=1",mailto:div-a-webadmin@eng.cam.ac.uk,No data,"https://www.linkedin.com/in/nishad-sohoni-2854a0bb/?originalSubdomain=uk

We study theoretically and numerically the gravitational instability of a diffusive boundary layer in the presence of a first-order precipitation reaction. We compare the predictions from normal mode, linear stability analysis, and nonlinear numerical simulations, and discuss the relative deviations. The application of our findings to the storage of carbon dioxide in a siliciclastic aquifer shows that while the reactive-diffusive layer can become unstable within a timescale of 1 to 1.5 months after the injection of carbon dioxide, it can take almost 10 months for sufficiently vigorous convection to produce a considerable increase in the dissolution flux of carbon

The motion on privatizing the National Health Service (NHS) was specifically chosen to reflect the growing sentiment in the UK where further discourse upon models of healthcare was required. Time and again, the outcome of British elections pivots upon the topic of financial sustainability of the NHS.

Aim: The demographic and phenotypic characteristics of a UK cohort of 1194 patients with PSC are described.
Method: All patients were recruited as part of an ongoing national collaborative effort (PSC-UK) between October 2008 and May 2011. The diagnosis of PSC was confirmed on the basis of characteristic ERCP, MRCP or histology. Patients with small-duct PSC were also included. All patients completed a descriptive phenotypic questionnaire sent at recruitment. Demographic, phenotypic data and family history were extracted from the participant questionnaires.
Results: 1194 patients have returned completed questionnaires. Median age at recruitment was 59 years and 63% were male (male to female ratio =1.7:1). 64% of patients were lifelong non-smokers and only 4.3% were smoking at recruitment. 63.5% reported inflammatory bowel disease, split into 87% with Ulcerative colitis and 13% with Crohn's disease. 1.5% had a sibling with PSC and 14% had a sibling with inflammatory bowel disease. Further, 0.5% had one or more children with PSC and 4.6% had children with inflammatory bowel disease. 24% were asymptomatic, but over 50% reported itching and fatigue as the presenting symptom. Jaundice was present in 35%. The most common associated autoimmune disease was thyroid disease, present in 9% followed by Coeliac disease in 2.1% and type 1 diabetes mellitus in 1.8%. 16% of patients reported pan-procto or sub-total colectomy and 12.2% had undergone cholecystectomy. 2.7% of patients reported a history of colon cancer and 1.25% patients had a history of skin cancer.
Conclusion: This is the largest reported demographic and phenotypic description of a single cohort of PSC patients. PSC is more common in young, non-smoking male patients. The frequency of associated inflammatory bowel disease is similar to that reported in other studies. It is plausible that siblings of patients with PSC have an increased risk of not only PSC but also inflammatory bowel disease. These data are consistent with increasing evidence pointing to a role of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of PSC.",Hospital & Health Care,"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, UK","Greater Cambridge Area, United Kingdom",",No data","Medicine Royal College of Physicians, London, UK",No data,No data,No data,No data,No data,No data,No data,No data,MBBS,No data,2002,Manipal Academy of Higher Education,"Clinical Research Fellow, Hepatology at Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, ","https://rocketreach.co/500,https://rocketreach.co/Profile,https://static.rocketreach.co/default/dppm7.png,https://rocketreach.co/static/images/logo/logoWhiteRocketBlueHaloWhiteText.png,https://rocketreach.co/image/png",",Found 1 email:,mailto:support@repository.cam.ac.uk,@yahoo.co.in,Brijesh Srivastava's Email",No data,"https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/294741

Nivarti,By: Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge,Girish Venkata Nivarti: Dancing in the Wind/Combustion & Flame V",No data,",Contact Details,Social media links,Recent advances in computing technology have made detailed theoretical investigations of turbulent combustion feasible. Highly accurate numerical simulations of canonical problems offer a window into the physical and thermo-chemical processes that operate at the smallest scales of turbulent motion. The simulation results shown above present snapshots of gas density evolving over several microseconds in a region of intense turbulent fluctuations typically observed in jet engines and gas turbines. In this combustion regime, we can observe the flame (represented, approximately, by the region of transition between reactants and products) being broadened, wrinkled, stretched and eventually broken by the continuous action of the surrounding gases. Prediction of pollutant emissions, heat release rates and possible flame extinction rely on a comprehensive understanding of these underlying phenomena.

We have recently devised a general tool for conditional protein degradation in vertebrate cells, and used it to disable or reconstitute homologous recombination during different stages of the cell cycle, engendering a model in which homologous recombination during G2 is segregated from replication in S, and chromosome segregation, in M. We have combined biophysical microscopy with cell biology to identify a transient and rapid alteration in chromatin structure that precedes and permits phosphorylation of the variant histone, H2AX, defining a new signaling pathway that senses DNA breakage, and showing that chromatin structure can be changed during a physiological process via modification of a histone-code effector rather than the code itself.",No data,",The Gateway to Research: UKRI portal onto publically funded research,personal profile,Contents,Research,Menu,Eileen TENG,Ashok is the Ursula Zoellner Professor of Cancer Research in the Medical Research Council (MRC) Cancer Unit at the University of Cambridge.

The diagnosis relies on histological examination of esophageal mucosal biopsies and requires the presence of > 15 eosinophils per high-powered field. Potential pitfalls include the impact of biopsy sectioning as well as regional variations of eosinophil density. We performed genome-wide DNA methylation analyses on 30 esophageal biopsies obtained from children diagnosed with EoE (n = 7) and matched controls (n = 13) at the time of diagnosis as well as following first-line treatment. Analyses revealed striking disease-associated differences in mucosal DNA methylation profiles in children diagnosed with EoE, highlighting the potential for these epigenetic signatures to be developed into clinically applicable biomarkers.",No data,"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, UK","Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition, Cambridge University Hospitals, Addenbrooke’s,

We characterized motivation for monetary outcomes in depressed outpatients (N = 39, 22 female) and controls (N = 22, 11 female) in terms of their effectiveness in seeking rewards and avoiding losses. We assessed motivational function during learning of associations between stimuli and actions, as well as when learning was complete. We compared the activity within neural circuits underpinning these behaviors between depressed patients and controls.   Methods We used a Go/No-Go task that assessed subjects’ abilities in learning to emit or withhold actions to obtain monetary rewards or avoid losses. We derived motivation-relevant parameters of behavior (learning rate, Pavlovian bias, and motivational influence of gains and losses). After learning, participants performed the task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We compared neural activation during anticipation of action emission vs. action inhibition, and for actions performed to obtain rewards compared to actions that avoid losses.   Results Depressed patients showed a similar Pavlovian bias to controls and were equivalent in terms of withholding action to gain rewards and emitting action to avoid losses, behaviors that conflict with well-described Pavlovian tendencies to approach rewards and avoid losses. Patients were not impaired in overall performance or learning and showed no abnormal neural responses, for example in bilateral midbrain or striatum. We conclude that basic mechanisms subserving motivated learning are thus intact in moderate depression.   Implications Therapeutically, the intact mechanisms identified here suggest that learning-based interventions may be particularly effective in encouraging recovery. Etiologically, our results suggest that the severe motivational deficits clinically observed in depression are likely to have complex origins, possibly related to an impairment in the representation of future states necessary for long-term planning.,Author Disclosure Statement,Abstract",Higher Education,"UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, UK",",20894,,,8600 Rockville Pike,USA,London, England, United Kingdom,Bethesda,MD,National Center for

Mobile health (mHealth) apps, apps that run on mobile platforms, may help promote active living.
Objective: We aimed to quantify the effect of mHealth app interventions on sedentary time, PA, and fitness in older adults.
Methods: We systematically searched five electronic databases for trials investigating the effects of mHealth app interventions on sedentary time, PA, and fitness among community-dwelling older adults aged 55 years and older. We calculated pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) in these outcomes between the intervention and control groups after the intervention period. We performed a Cochrane risk of bias assessment and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation certainty assessment.
Results: Overall, six trials (486 participants, 66.7% [324/486] women; age mean 68 [SD 6] years) were included (five of these trials were included in the meta-analysis). mHealth app interventions may be associated with decreases in sedentary time (SMD=−0.49; 95% CI −1.02 to 0.03), increases in PA (506 steps/day; 95% CI −80 to 1092), and increases in fitness (SMD=0.31; 95% CI −0.09 to 0.70) in trials of 3 months or shorter and with increases in PA (753 steps/day; 95% CI −147 to 1652) in trials of 6 months or longer. Risk of bias was low for all but one study. The quality of evidence was moderate for PA and sedentary time and low for fitness.
Conclusions: mHealth app interventions have the potential to promote changes in sedentary time and PA over the short term, but the results did not achieve statistical significance, possibly because studies were underpowered by small participant numbers.

Plants encode multiple AGO proteins but, in Arabidopsis, only AGO1 is known to have an antiviral role.   Methodology/Principal Findings To uncover the roles of specific AGOs in limiting virus accumulation we inoculated turnip crinkle virus (TCV) to Arabidopsis plants that were mutant for each of the ten AGO genes. The viral symptoms on most of the plants were the same as on wild type plants although the ago2 mutants were markedly hyper-susceptible to this virus. ago2 plants were also hyper-susceptible to cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), confirming that the antiviral role of AGO2 is not specific to a single virus. For both viruses, this phenotype was associated with transient increase in virus accumulation. In wild type plants the AGO2 protein was induced by TCV and CMV infection.   Conclusions/Significance Based on these results we propose that there are multiple layers to RNA-mediated defense and counter-defense in the interactions between plants and their viruses. AGO1 represents a first layer. With some viruses, including TCV and CMV, this layer is overcome by viral suppressors of silencing that can target AGO1 and a second layer involving AGO2 limits virus accumulation. The second layer is activated when the first layer is suppressed because AGO2 is repressed by AGO1 via miR403. The activation of the second layer is therefore a direct consequence of the loss of the first layer of defense.,METHODS,.,Object moved to,Discovery Research Services,A large and diverse miRNA superfamily targets mRNAs of disease resistance proteins and initiates phased secondary siRNA that target other mRNAs.

In a rat model of myocardial injury, we demonstrated that injections of hPSC-derived epicardium improve engraftment and beneficial effects of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes. Therefore, we investigate the cross-talk between hPSC-epicardium, hPSC-cardiomyocytes and host tissues.
