I started as a Temporary Visual Arts Specialist. In November 2010 I was hired on full time as the Web & Graphic Designer for the Department of Radiology. My work at Stanford is very gratifying. I never expected, as an artist, to have my work matter in a way that could help other people. With each new project, I am (in a small way) contributing to the research and development of new and innovative treatments for many of the most damaging diseases. My art helps the great minds of our department explain their thinking, their research, and their findings to others in their field.,I started my professional career as a Visual Designer at IBM for the Storage Systems Group. My work at IBM involved close interaction with our user experience designers. The team I was on developed a software interface to help facilitate storage administrators in monitoring their storage subsystems. We created an interface that allowed the admin to see storage system status at a glance using a drill down table as well as custom built icons. The work our team completed earned several US Patents.,10 Results / Page,Last,I'm a passionate designer with 19 years of experience in interface, print, and web design. I love to make things look, work, and act more efficiently. Some might call it compulsion...I like to call it passion. My mind and heart are always open to challenging design problems. I thrive on finding innovative solutions to complex situations.,Looking forward, our ability to super-selectively deliver new therapies directly to target organs.  These therapies include nanoparticles, stem cells and gene therapy and will open new pathways into the emerging field of Interventional Regenerative Medicine.,Dr. Nick Telischak is a neurointerventional surgeon (neurointerventional radiologist) who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of stroke, brain aneurysms, brain arteriovenous malformations, brain and spinal dural arteriovenous fistulae, carotid artery stenosis, vertebral body compression fractures, spinal metastases, axial back pain, and congenital vascular malformations. Dr. Telischak treats all of these conditions using minimally-invasive, image-guided procedures and state-of-the-art technology.,For details see https://web.stanford.edu/group/tanglab/,Current research areas include: (I) Physics of droplets in microfluidic systems, (II) Interfacial mass transport and self-assembly, and (III) Applications in food allergy, single-cell wound repair, and the bottom-up construction of synthetic cell and tissues in close collaboration with clinicians and biochemists at the Stanford School of Medicine, UCSF, and University of Michigan.,The long-term goal of Dr. Tang's research program is to harness mass transport in microfluidic systems to accelerate precision medicine and material design for a future with better health and environmental sustainability.,First,Over the past decade there has been tremendous advances in the field of Interventional Oncology with the clinical utilization of multiple new innovative locoregional therapies (i.e. chemoembolization, percutaneous ablation).","http://daldrup-link-lab.stanford.edu/people.html
